Excited to share new project : 
üåç World Harmony - A voice for Change and Compassion 

Built using Node.js | Express.js | EJS | CSS
 I've developed a web application called World Harmony - a platform dedicated to raising awareness about global incidents that deeply affect humanity, such as tragic attacks, disasters and humanities crises.

These events often leave behind pain, broken families and a deep need for support emotionally, socially and structurally.

Through World Harmony, users can:
 1.Read about current global incidents affecting lives and communities.
 2. Donate solutions or ideas to help prevent similar incidents in the future.
 3. Offer support to affected individuals or families.
 4. File complaints or raise concerns to the appropriate authorities.
 5. Join a movement of empathy, awareness, and proactive change.

The goal is not just awareness-it's collaborative healing and prevention.

This is just the beginning. In the future, I plan to add new features such as:
 1. Verified donation campaigns
 2. AI-based incident categorization
 3. Real-time alerts and reporting
 4. Community forums for discussion and idea-sharing
 5. Language support for broader accessibility
